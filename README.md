# 4-russians-algorithm
Implementation of the 4 russians algorithm for boolean matrix multiplication.

Boolean matrices are matrices containing only 1s and 0s as entries. Matrix multiplication on boolean matrices A x B can be defined using boolean multiplication (logical AND) and boolean addition (logical OR). Like the following example:
